# Research V2 Implementation - Final Summary

## üéØ Project Overview

Successfully designed and architected a new Research V2 page at `/research/v2/[searchId]` with a modern, card-based interface that transforms the existing research experience. The new design features:

- **Modern Card-Based Layout**: Clean, consistent visual hierarchy
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Animated progress bars and status updates
- **Animated Sidebar Configuration**: Smooth slide-in panel with dynamic forms
- **Staggered Animations**: Engaging micro-interactions throughout
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Theme Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Perplexity theme

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### **Framework Integration**
- **Vue 3 Composition API**: Modern reactive patterns
- **Nuxt 3**: Server-side rendering and routing
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling approach
- **Perplexity Theme**: Consistent design system integration
- **Lucide Vue Next**: Icon system integration

### **Key Design Patterns**
- **Inline Components**: Faster development and easier customization
- **CSS Transitions**: Smooth animations without external dependencies
- **Teleport API**: Proper modal/sidebar rendering
- **Computed Properties**: Reactive state management
- **Staggered Animations**: Enhanced user experience

### **State Management**
```javascript
// Core reactive state
const isLoading = ref(true)
const isSidebarOpen = ref(false)
const researchData = ref(null)
const submitResult = ref(null)
const formData = ref({...})

// Computed properties for dynamic behavior
const agentId = computed(() => route.query.agentId || 'market-research')
const mainContentClasses = computed(() => [...])
```

## üé® Visual Design Implementation

### **Card System**
- Consistent border radius and spacing
- Subtle shadows and hover states
- Proper content hierarchy with icons
- Status badges with dynamic colors

### **Animation System**
- **Sidebar**: Slide-in from right with backdrop fade
- **Content**: Fade-up animations with staggered timing
- **Progress**: Smooth width transitions
- **Insights**: Sequential reveal with delays

### **Color Palette** (Perplexity Theme)
- `bg-base`: Main background
- `bg-raised`: Card backgrounds
- `text-foreground`: Primary text
- `text-super`: Accent color
- `border-subtler`: Subtle borders
